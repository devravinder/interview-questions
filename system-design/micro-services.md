# ðŸ§© Microservices Design Patterns

## 1. Decomposition Patterns
- **By Business Capability** â†’ Services align with domain areas (e.g., Payments, Orders, Inventory).  
- **By Subdomain (DDD)** â†’ Use *Domain-Driven Design* to identify bounded contexts.  
- **Strangler Fig Pattern** â†’ Gradually replace monolith pieces with microservices.  

---

## 2. Integration Patterns
- **API Gateway** â†’ Single entry point for clients, routes to services.  
- **Aggregator** â†’ One service calls multiple others and aggregates results.  
- **Proxy** â†’ Gateway just forwards requests, adds security, throttling.  
- **Chained Service Calls** â†’ Service â†’ Service â†’ Service (can get risky with latency).  
- **Asynchronous Messaging** â†’ Use queues/events (Kafka, RabbitMQ) to decouple services.  

---

## 3. Database Patterns
- **Database per Service** â†’ Each service owns its data (most common).  
- **Shared Database** â†’ Multiple services share one DB (not recommended, but sometimes practical).  
- **Saga Pattern** â†’ Distributed transaction management via events/compensating actions.  
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** â†’ Separate read/write models for performance.  
- **Event Sourcing** â†’ Store state as a series of events instead of just final state.  

---

## 4. Observability Patterns
- **Log Aggregation** â†’ Centralized logs (ELK, Loki).  
- **Distributed Tracing** â†’ Trace requests across services (Jaeger, Zipkin, Tempo).  
- **Health Check API** â†’ Each service exposes `/health` for monitoring.  
- **Metrics Aggregation** â†’ Collect metrics (Prometheus + Grafana).  

---

## 5. Resiliency Patterns
- **Circuit Breaker** â†’ Stop calls to failing service (e.g., Resilience4j, Hystrix).  
- **Retry Pattern** â†’ Retry failed calls with backoff.  
- **Timeout Pattern** â†’ Donâ€™t let one service hang others.  
- **Bulkhead** â†’ Isolate failures so one service doesnâ€™t crash the system.  
- **Fail-Fast** â†’ Quickly reject if downstream is not available.  
- **Fallback** â†’ Provide default response when service fails.  

---

## 6. Security Patterns
- **Access Token (JWT, OAuth2)** â†’ Secure service-to-service & client calls.  
- **API Gateway Authentication** â†’ Central place for auth.  
- **Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd)** â†’ Handles mTLS, auth, rate limiting at infra level.  

---

## 7. Deployment Patterns
- **Blue-Green Deployment** â†’ Switch traffic between two environments.  
- **Canary Release** â†’ Gradually roll out new versions.  
- **Sidecar Pattern** â†’ Extra container alongside a service (e.g., Envoy proxy).  
- **Service Mesh** â†’ Offload cross-cutting concerns (security, retries, tracing).  

---

âœ… These patterns are often **combined** in real-world microservices systems depending on business needs, scalability, and reliability.

# In Detail
# âš“ Bulkhead Pattern (Resiliency)

## ðŸ“Œ What It Is  
The **Bulkhead pattern** is a resiliency design pattern that **isolates failures** in a system so that when one part fails, it doesnâ€™t bring down everything else.  

Itâ€™s inspired by ships:  
- A ship has *bulkheads* (partitions) so if one compartment floods, the others stay safe.  
- Similarly, in microservices, you isolate resources so a failure in one area wonâ€™t sink the entire system.  

---

## ðŸ›  How It Works  
- Allocate **separate resources** (threads, DB connections, memory pools) per service or per feature.  
- If one service gets overloaded, it **only consumes its own quota**, not the entire pool.  
- Prevents a "noisy neighbor" problem where one service hogs resources and starves others.  

---

## âœ… Example  
Imagine an **e-commerce app** with:
- **Payment Service**
- **Order Service**
- **Notification Service**

If the **Payment Service** suddenly gets slow (maybe the bank API is lagging):
- **Without bulkhead** â†’ all system threads are stuck waiting, and Orders + Notifications also fail.  
- **With bulkhead** â†’ only the Payment Serviceâ€™s thread pool is affected, Orders + Notifications still work.  

---

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Approaches  
- **Thread pool per service** â†’ Each service gets its own threads.  
- **Connection pool isolation** â†’ Separate DB connections per microservice.  
- **Rate limiting per service** â†’ Prevent one service from exhausting shared resources.  
- **With Circuit Breaker** â†’ Often combined: bulkhead isolates, circuit breaker stops repeated failures.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Frameworks  
- **Java / Spring Boot** â†’ Use *Resilience4j* bulkhead module (`BulkheadRegistry`).  
- **.NET** â†’ *Polly* provides bulkhead policies.  
- **Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)** â†’ Can enforce isolation & limits at infra level.  

---

ðŸ‘‰ **In short:** Bulkhead = *Contain the blast radius of a failure*.
