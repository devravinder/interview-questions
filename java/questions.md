# Java Interview Questions

## Core Java

1. What is JDK & JVM?
2. What is a JIT compilation?  `*`
3. what are OOPs features?  `*`
4. What is abstraction?
5. What is Data hiding?
6. How does class loading work?
7. What is a constructor?
8. What is final?
9. What is static?
10. What is abstract?
11. Why it is not allowed to mark a class static? `*`
12. Why Strings are immutable in Java? `*`
13. String Vs StringBuffer Vs StringBuilder?
14. What is String Pool? How it works? `***`
    1. How many objects will get created for the below code?
       ```java
        String s1 = "hello";
        String s2 = new String("world");
       ```
    2. How many objects?
       ```java
       String s2 = new String("world");
       ```
    3. How to make Heap String object to point to pool object?
       - using `intern()` method.
       - The intern() method moves the string to the string pool (if not already present) and returns a reference to the pooled instance.
       - ```java
            public class StringInternExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                String heapString = new String("Hello"); // Created in heap memory
                String poolString = heapString.intern(); // Moved to string pool

                String literalString = "Hello"; // Already in the string pool

                System.out.println(poolString == literalString); // true, both refer to the same object in the string pool
                    }
            }

         ```

    4. What will be the output? Why
       ```java
         String s1 = "hello";
         String s2 = new String("hello");
         String s3 = "hello";
         System.out.println(s1==s2);
         System.out.println(s1==s3);
         String s4 = s2.intern();
         System.out.println(s1==s4);
       ```
15. Whay is `wrpper pool`? How it works?  `***`
    - it is same like `string pool` but wrapper classes
    - it stores/creates obejcts in `wrpper pool` for `Wrapper objects` 
    - it creates obejcts only if the wrapper object is in `byte range` ie `-128 to 127`
    - evey wrapper class has it's own pool

    - Guess the output?
      ```java
        Integer i1 = 127;
        Integer i2 = new Integer(127);
        Integer i3 = Integer.valueOf(127);
        Integer i4 = 127;


        System.out.println(i1 == i2);
        System.out.println(i1 == i3);
        System.out.println(i1 == i4);
        System.out.println("----------");
      ```
16. `hashCode()` vs `System.identityHashCode()` vs `Object.hashCode()`
    - `Object.hashCode()`
       - this returns hashcode based on `memory` address
       - this won't consider object state / contents
    - `System.identityHashCode()`
       - this internally calls `Object.hashCode()`, so returns hashcode based on `memory` address

    - `hashCode()`
      - this methods exists in Object class, can be overriden
      - Generally, we'll override this, based on the object state
        - such a way, obejcts with some state should retrun same hascode
      - if we won't override..then internally it calls `Object.hashCode()`

42.  Can we use Object as a key in HashMap? [ eg: Employee class object ]? `***`
     - Yes, we can use. But we should use immutable class, else it'll lead to hash collision
43. Hash Collision?
44. Can we add two objects with the same data/states in HashSet/HashMap? Will it allow all? What is the count?
    - Depends on the hashcode implementation,
